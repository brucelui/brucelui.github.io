						<br><br><p>I had the opportunity to go on a 8 month co-op term and later a part-time position at Ensemble Systems as an User Experience Designer, where I was able to work on designing the visual aspect and architectural system for various platforms like Xbox One, iOS, Android, Websites, and streaming service platforms like Samsung Smart TV. My contribution during my term earned a lot of recognition from my peers and clients.</p>

						<hr>
						
						<p>Since it was my first placement in the working industry I was given some internal projects to warm up with, to eventually having the opportunity to work on external projects alongside with clients.</p>

						
						<div class="sub"><h7>Understanding the guidelines was crucial when designing for each different platforms. But I was encouraged to go beyond.</h7></div>
						
						<img src="images/ensemble_5.jpg">
						<br><h8>EXPO for iOS</h8>
						<p>The process begins with a meeting with the client to understand the project needs and goal and then I start sketching out the information archetecture and drawing wireframes.</p>


						<div class="sub"><h7>One of my goals during my stay at Ensemble was to push myself and seek for constructive feedback to enhance my learning progress.</h7></div>
						<p>So when my iterative process come to a near-end, I would ask for feedback within the UX team and sometimes outside so I could view my progress and learn from another one's perspective.
						</p>

						<br><h8>EXPO for iOS</h8>
						
						<p>Here is an example of my contribution to help design on the company's EXPO product line for the <strong>iOS</strong> and also eventually for the <strong>Samsung Smart TV</strong>.</p>
						
						<img src="images/ensemble_2.jpg">
						<br><h8>Ensemble Solutions storefront</h8>

						<p>I was introduced to <strong>Adobe DPS</strong> (Digital Publishing Suite) where I had the chance to design storefronts and folios. Displayed above is the finished product of a redesign of the storefront for the company's sales department, where I was entrusted with the entire design.</p>

						<img src="images/ensemble_3.gif">
						<br><h8>one of the folios inside the storefront</h8>
						
						<p>Using Adobe InDesign CC, I helped designed and produced several folios for the company storefront. Playing around with Edge Animate CC, I was able to explore and implement animations, and different kinds of interactions within the folios.</p>

						<br><h8>UX Microsite</h8>
						<br>

						<div class="sub"><h7>I got to have my first exposure to working with developers on projects.</h7></div>

						<p>The UX Microsite (shown above) is a branch site to showcase the various projects from the UX side of company, and is also one of the projects where I was able to start to understand how to communicate and provide the needs to developers.</p>

						<p>I took part in designing the entire site, along with some of the logos and icons. The rest, I had to work alongside with a developer and make sure the designs gets through to the development. </p>

						<br><br><br><img src="images/ensemble_7.jpg">
						<br><h8>Samsung Smart TV app for Epix</h8>
						
						<div class="sub"><h7>One of the biggest challenge that I faced was designing for a larger canvas.</h7></div>
						<p>
							Such as designing a streaming service app for the Xbox One and the Samsung Smart TV platforms. How we perceive information and interacting to a TV with a controller is much different than with touchscreens on mobile and tablets. It was something outside my comfort zone, but I am glad that I had the opportunity to expand on my expertise.
